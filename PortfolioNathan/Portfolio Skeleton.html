                UX Team to perform usability tests on an upcoming update to the

                we were able to gauge how effective the existing tagging system
                was with potential users of the website.

                was updated to be compatible with web/network systems. Can I

                This project was inspired by a curiosity about the inner
                workings of the Fastpass system in place at the Disney World
                Orlando resort. Using what I knew about SQL, I desired to make a
                database that would manage the various permissions and accesses
                that a guest had in a seamless and minimum friction way for the
                guest.

                BLUF: Is there a correlation between the value of Sentimental
                Items and Functional Ones? I will create an interactive
                visualization to help showcase the gap in value between these

                This project was born of an attempt to blend my hobby interest
                in Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games(MMORPG) and
                my interest in Data visualization. MMORPGs are a type of game
                typified by a shared playing space that many users can log into
                at the same time and encounter one another, trade items, and
                enjoy content together. The intermingling of players naturally
                creates virtual economies that reflect the way items are valued
                with regard to their use in gameplay, which became the basis of
                my first research question.
                <br />
                _____________
                <br />
                Having played Runescape myself, I was aware of a type of item
                that always retained its high value since it was introduced and
                I wanted to use graphs to illustrate the sheer gap in value
                between the Party Hats and Weapons which had obvious, tangible
                value as tools used in gameplay.

                <br />
                <br />
                Using a large csv file containing 3 columns: Name_ID, Price(in
                Gold Pieces), and Date. My goal was to illustrate the effects of
                game updates on the price of items using a line chart that has
                selectable dates and animates the motion of the line in the
                elapsed time.
                <br />
                _____________
                <br />
                In order to sort the data for display on the graphs, I had to
                use Runescape community resources like wikis and trading guides
                in order to match Name_IDs to recognizable game items.

                BLUF: Is Gastro-Tourist Journalism the best way to get to know a
                city? I will create a story map that follows along with
                restaurant ranking lists to demonstrate the overall range and
                coverage of the listâ€™s destinations, as well as gauging the
                average price range of them. I began this project with an
                assumption that journalists would overall choose a selection of
                restaurants that trend toward expense and spectacle over
                restaurants that average people can afford to visit often.
                Methodology: My method for illustrating this was a story map
                that follows restaurant ranking lists to see if that assumption
                was true or not. My tools for this project was ArcGIS and the
