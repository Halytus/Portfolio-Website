                BLUF: The Smithsonian American Art Museum at Renwick hired our
                UX Team to perform usability tests on an upcoming update to the
                search function user interface.
                <br />
                <br />
                Methodology: Using card sorting we were able to gauge how
                effective the existing tagging system was with potential users
                of the website. Additionally, each member of the team conducted
                moderated user tests in person and over zoom so that we could
                learn in real time what the pain points of the new website
                features were.

                that a guest had in a seamless and minimum friction way for the

                BLUF: Is there a correlation between the value of Sentimental
                Items and Functional Ones? I will create an interactive
                visualization to help showcase the gap in value between these
                different types of items and try to outline the game-specific
                details that make their values noteworthy. _____________
                <br />
                <br />
                This project was born of an attempt to blend my hobby interest
                in Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games(MMORPG) and
                my interest in Data visualization. MMORPGs are a type of game
                typified by a shared playing space that many users can log into
                at the same time and encounter one another, trade items, and
                enjoy content together. The intermingling of players naturally
                creates virtual economies that reflect the way items are valued
                with regard to their use in gameplay, which became the basis of
                my first research question.
                <br />
                <br />
                Having played Runescape myself, I was aware of a type of item
                that always retained its high value since it was introduced and
                I wanted to use graphs to illustrate the sheer gap in value
                between the Party Hats and Weapons which had obvious, tangible
                value as tools used in gameplay. _____________
                <br />
                <br />
                Methodology: Using a large csv file containing 3 columns:
                Name_ID, Price(in Gold Pieces), and Date. My goal was to
                illustrate the effects of game updates on the price of items
                using a line chart that has selectable dates and animates the
                motion of the line in the elapsed time. In order to sort the
                data for display on the graphs, I had to use Runescape community
                resources like wikis and trading guides in order to match
                Name_IDs to recognizable game items. My choices for styling the
                website were made to resemble some of the old in-game interfaces
                for the Grand Exchange, and the graphs themselves were intended
                to keep the same color scheme with a gold line to depict the
                item’s value.
                My tools for this project are R-Studio for data cleaning and manipulation, HTML, CSS, and Highcharts.js for hosting and visualization.
                <br />
                <br />
                Hurdles/Roadblocks: Some of the items in the dataset are missing price points for certain dates, which causes them to be unusable for some correlation analysis methods. In the future I could calculate the mean or median price and impute the values to cover the missing data points. There were many pain points involved in my implementation of highcharts.js stemming from my inexperience with both the specific library and javascript in general.

                BLUF: Is Gastro-Tourist Journalism the best way to get to know a
                city? I will create a story map that follows along with

                assumption that journalists would overall choose a selection of
                restaurants that trend toward expense and spectacle over
                restaurants that average people can afford to visit often.
                Methodology: My method for illustrating this was a story map
                that follows restaurant ranking lists to see if that assumption
